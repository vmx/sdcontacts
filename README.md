SD Contacts
===========

An Android app that automatically stores your contacts on your SD card.

This app is meant for users that don't want to synchronize their contacts online, but want to keep them local to the phone.
Though there is a problem, if you brick your phone, you might lose all your contacts.
With this app, you will have a backup of your contacts stored on the SD card. You can take it out and import the contacts into your new phone.

This App works with Android API level 26 or higher (Android 8.0 Oreo).
